You are tasked with creating a knowledge graph in Turtle format based on a given text. A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that shows entities (things, concepts, or people) and the relationships between them.

Here is the text you will use to create the knowledge graph:

<text>
"<placeholder_text>"
</text>

Turtle is a textual syntax for RDF (Resource Description Framework) that allows an RDF graph to be completely written in a compact and natural text form. Here's a brief overview of Turtle syntax:

1. Entities are represented as URIs, usually in the format <http://example.org/entity>
2. Relationships are represented as predicates, also as URIs
3. Statements are in the form: subject predicate object .
4. The full stop (.) is used to terminate statements

Follow these steps to create the knowledge graph:

1. Identify key entities in the text. These could be people, places, organizations, or important concepts.

2. Identify relationships between these entities. Look for verbs or phrases that connect entities.

3. For each entity and relationship, create Turtle statements. Use meaningful URIs for entities and predicates. For example:
   <http://example.org/JohnDoe> <http://example.org/worksFor> <http://example.org/CompanyX> .

4. If you encounter literal values (like dates, numbers, or strings), represent them appropriately in Turtle syntax. For example:
   <http://example.org/JohnDoe> <http://example.org/age> "30"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> .

5. If you need to make multiple statements about the same subject, you can use semicolons to separate predicates and objects:
   <http://example.org/JohnDoe> 
     <http://example.org/name> "John Doe" ;
     <http://example.org/age> "30"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> .

6. Use appropriate namespaces to shorten URIs when possible. Define these at the beginning of your Turtle document. For example:
   @prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
   @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

   ex:JohnDoe foaf:name "John Doe" .

Create the knowledge graph based on the given text, following these guidelines:

- Use clear and consistent URIs for entities and predicates
- Include all relevant information from the text
- Use appropriate data types for literal values
- Use namespaces to make the Turtle representation more readable

Return your final Turtle representation of the knowledge graph without any additional explanations. Make sure the Turtle is valid and correctly represents the information in the text.
Do not return "response: ```turtle" or "```" or any other markdown formatting in your response.
